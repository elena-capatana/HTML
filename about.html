                    <h2>Elena Capatana</h2>
                    <p>Webdeveloper currently at the wrong job</p>
                    <p>Elena is an aspiring web developer who has taken the scenic route to the tech world. She first dipped her toes into programming with C++ back in high school but then decided to design buildings instead of websites, leading her to study architecture at university. To fund her studies, she took a job at a call centerâ€”and, like a bad software update, stayed there a decade longer than planned. Now, she is finally circling back to her true passion for coding and web development. Better late than never, right?</p>
